Lulu's Lemons Project Repository - working with Matt "Money" Marks and baseball data.


Master Sword:

1. final_scrapedraft.R produces ScrapedPlayerDraft.csv

This is the draft information of every player drafted from years 2005 to 2010 in the 1st to 12th rounds of the MLB draft.
final_scrapedraft.R can be changed to scrape other years and rounds. Do not change/do not push changes to final_scrapedraft.R.
If ScrapedPlayerDraft.csv is available to you, read in the CSV instead of running final_scrapedraft.R

2. clean_scrapeddraft.R cleans ScrapedPlayerDraft.csv and produces Players.csv
